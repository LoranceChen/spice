###UUID
//1. network data be recoginzed by UUID
//2. distinguish usage layer by specify UUID
//  such as, session use 0x1000000L ~ 0x1000,00ffL to represent it used.(at `spice.socket.session.exception`)
//3. todo manage UUID rather then define everywhere

###Exp:
1. NEVER use null, use default class replace.
:: If I set variable as a Class , means I want this type to solve my problem, why I use null?
it just a legacy at period c/c++, java shouldn't be and scala never use even more.
